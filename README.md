# CSS-D Project: IMBD Data
### Exploratory analysis of a large movie dataset using pandas for performance insights.

## Introduction
This project applies data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis techniques on a movie dataset to extract key aspects of performance, including ratings, revenue, director contributions, and trends over time. It also provides insights into the actors and genres involved.

## Prerequisites
The project requires the `pandas` library in Python, which is highly effective for data manipulation and analysis.
You can install it using:
```bash
pip install pandas
```
## Project features
- **Data Loading and cleaning**: Reads the dataset from the CSV file, and fills missing values with mean values where appropriate.
- **Data Analysis**: The script addresses the following questions:
  - What is the highest-rated movie in the dataset?
  - What is the average revenue of all movies?
  - What is the average revenue of movies released from 2015 to 2017?
  - How many movies were released in the year 2016?
  - How many movies were directed by Christopher Nolan?
  - How many movies in the dataset have a rating of at least 8.0?
  - What is the median rating of movies directed by Christopher Nolan?
  - Which year had the highest average rating?
  - What is the percentage increase in the number of movies made between 2006 and 2016?
  - Who is the most common actor in all the movies?
  - How many unique genres are there in the dataset?

## Usage
To reproduce the analyses, download the provided script and dataset. 
Once both are in place, run the script to perform the analyses. 
The code is flexible and can be adapted for other projects.
